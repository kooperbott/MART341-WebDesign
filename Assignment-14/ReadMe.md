How did your user testing sessions go?
They went well. My mother and brother both tested my site. They both had issues with the pictures being weirdly shaped but I amd still working
on picking what pictures I want, where I want them, and the sizes that I want them. They both gave me good feedback on the color scheme
and that I had good information on what equine massage is and why it is important for perfomance hroses. 


What changes (if any) did you make to your website based on the user feedback you received?

I fixed the video link that wasnt working. I played around with some of the pictuers but still have a lot of work to do on them. 
I am also still gathering some images I hope to add into the website. I added the foral heading to all of the pages so that it
crated uniformatiy within all the pages.
