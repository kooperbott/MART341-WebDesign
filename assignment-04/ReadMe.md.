Web browsers work when a request is sent to a server.
The server responds with a collection of web content 
The browser that sent the initial request interprets the content and then displays the page.
Browsers I currently surf quite often include:
https://moodle.umt.edu/ For all my homework and to keep up with what is happening in my classes.
https://www.amazon.com/ Because a parcel a day keeps the depression away!
https://www.redaspenlove.com/kooperbott1/ Got to keep those nails fresh so they look good for all the homework I've been typing.
